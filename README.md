## History

The original program was created by [Studio Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/) in 1999, and was used in [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/) and [Azarashi](https://www.cavestory.org/pixels-works/azarashi.php).

It was then updated multiple times by [Rxo Inverse](https://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/index.html) throughout 2003-2014, and was used in [STARGAZER](https://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/stargazerj.html)

As of this being written, [Strultz](https://strultz.github.io/) is working on [OrgMaker 3](https://github.com/Strultz/orgmaker-3/tree/main), which aims to add more features to OrgMaker.
