Extended the frequency limit from 100-1900 to 0-30000
Added a new file! (.org16 for use with the 16 tracks in OrgMaker 16, note: it'll be a normal ORG file if none of the new tracks are used.)
Made the drams appear in ResourceHacker again.
Made some error messages appear in normal textboxes again.

Disabled MIDI Export, it just crashes OrgMaker because MIDI supports ONLY 16 channels and not 32.

	Goals:

		-Finish the volume functions

		-Add a some Panning functions

		-Fix clicking drums disables channels bug(Click Q and then 1, you'll get what I mean.)

		-Finish functions regarding to Channels 9-32(Mem. usage, copying, etc.)
