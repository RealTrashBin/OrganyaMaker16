Extended the frequency limit from 100-1900 to 0-30000
Added a new file! (.org16 for use with the 16 tracks in OrgMaker 16, note: it'll be a normal ORG file if none of the new tracks are used.)
Made the drams appear in ResourceHacker again.
Made some error messages appear in normal textboxes again.

Disabled MIDI Export, it won't work because MIDI supports ONLY 16 channels and not 32.

	Goals:
			Create Multi-delete function

			Add export to FT2 XM feature since it has 32 Tracks.
			(Remember the one Clownancy made.)

			Fix WAV export to allow 32 track output.
